    title: "Desktop wallets",
    info: "Desktop wallets run on operating systems (OS) like macOS, Microsoft Windows, or Linux OS. Desktop wallets are ideal for those who prefer to handle their finances on desktops.

    title: "Hardware wallets",
    info: "Hardware wallets are pieces of hardware that store users' private keys offline and are, as such, cold wallets. Hardware wallets have to be connected to a computer for the funds to be moved and are password or PIN protected. To gain access to the funds, a malicious party would need physical access to the device and know the password protecting the funds. However, hardware wallets can be expensive for users with smaller amounts of funds to store.",

    title: "Paper wallets",
    info: "Paper wallets are a more basic type of cold wallet and essentially involve printing out the private keys that control the funds onto a piece of paper and storing it. To access the funds, malicious actors would need access to that piece of paper. The main advantage of this type of wallet is its accessibility, as all that is needed is a pen and a piece of paper.",
